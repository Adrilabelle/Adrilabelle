- 👋 Hi, I’m @Adrilabelle
- 👀 I’m interested in A11Y, Clean Web Developpement, ecology and diversity...well, actually, I'm interested in a lot of things, I love to learn about everything, love story, sciences, Maths, architecture
- and we way people is, the way our brain works. I love of course know how things works, the code underneat the interface, how it is done, and how it can be better, faster, practical and energy cost frinedly.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java for backends and and Angular for frontend, API rest with node.js, and of course, I continue my path on HTML, CSS and JS, Phyton, PHP with Synfony AND Laravel (yes I now, same thing, but not the same) SQL and databases... I'm not exploring, I'm doing my best to understand the very basic concepts, that's why I put more effort on the coding logic learning, to seize the logics and the mecanics behind the logaritms, that whispers to he CPU of a computer.
-  I'm learing to le learn, I would love to be a Full Stack dev., to help people to do nice things, for a better world, for all of us.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Open source projetcs, and I would love to to learn how to do it. I started to do it with nice people on Zenika, but I'm a liitle bit blocked with react's structure, I keep persevering.
- 📫 How to reach me ? by e mail I think
- 😄 Pronouns: just Adri. Actually, I choose Adrilabelle because la belle sounded chic (french of course) when I was young, at Venezuela, and It was a form to said I was not ok with the opinion that I wasn't pretty enough)
- I'm a cool person.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can speak spanish, french, english, and I love poetry and neurosciences.
